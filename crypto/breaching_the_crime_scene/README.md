The police is investigating a suspicious web forum. They cannot find a way to access it though --- its protected with a password. 
Luckily, they've managed to set up a packet sniffer between the server and one of its microservices. Unluckily, the traffic is encrypted.
Can you help them out?
##### Connection info:
After starting an instance, use [sc](https://github.com/CTFd/snicat) to bind it to the port on your machine:
For the web service:
```
sc -b 5000 <instance_subdomain.instance_domain>
```
For the packet sniffer:
```
sc -b 8888 tcp-<instance_subdomain.instance_domain>
```
You can then connect to the web service on `https://localhost:5000` and to the packet sniffer `nc localhost 8888`.
The web server uses a cert signed by the CA in the `ca.crt` file. It is included for your convenience.
