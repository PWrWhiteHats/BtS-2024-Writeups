### mod_ari
For reasons unbeknown to humankind our target decided to encode a flag by using pairs of integers.
We managed to obtain some of them.
Can you find the flag?
a_i = [1609, 961662, 917667, 557244, 931717056, 927153951, 178868775, 372965939, 3738025605, 6922527163, 53305961088, 94034742228]
m_i = [2137, 1000039, 1000081, 1000099, 1000000033, 1000000087, 1000000093, 1000000007, 10000000019, 100000000003, 100000000019, 100000000057]
