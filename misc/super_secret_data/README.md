I have super secret data stored on my server. I let nobody inside. Well, sometimes I have some `guest`s visit, but you're not one of them. You will never break into [ip]

##### Connection info:
After starting an instance, use [sc](https://github.com/CTFd/snicat) to bind it to the port on your machine:
```
sc -b 43422 <instance_subdomain.instance_domain>
```
The service is now running on `localhost:43422`
